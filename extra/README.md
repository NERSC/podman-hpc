# Subxid Service

This is a example implemenation of a service to serve up
subuid/subgid mapping files.  The map is generated by 
querying an LDAP service and pulling information from
a description field in the LDAP record.  The example
includes a Docker image, a helm chart to deploy the
service and nginx frontend, and systemd template files.
The systemd files would be installed on any nodes where
the subuid/subgid mapping is needed.
